#################
###STEP 1: LOAD THE RAW DATA
##################
#CLear out everything from the environment 
rm(list=ls())
#load the  CSV files and save them as dataframes
Exp_Data_C2<-read.csv("EXP_DATA_COHORT2_18august2014.csv", dec=".", header = TRUE, sep = ",", check.names=FALSE )
summary(Exp_Data_C2)


#####NOTE THAT STEP 2 and STEP 3 are essentially the same thing, should be made into a function!!!!

##################
###step 2: reshape data - wide to long - and lineup adjacent columns with 
###leaf lengths and percent of each leaf missing
##################

#select the columns for leaf length 
mdata.la<-Exp_Data_C2[1:34]
#Now melt them with reshape2 package to create a dataframe with 
#leaf-lengths in long form 
mdata.la <- melt(mdata.la, id.var=c("cohort","seedling.id.no","block","trt", "sdlg.no", "sdlg.type"))
#rename the column "value" as leaf length
names(mdata.la)[names(mdata.la)=="value"] <- "leaf.length"
#now split the column with leaf number and time interval into 
#two columns to make it easier to sum leaf areas for individual plants 
names(mdata.la)[names(mdata.la)=="variable"] <- "leaf"
split <- mdata.la$leaf
split<-colsplit(split, ".t", c("leaf", "interval"))

cohort2.la<-cbind(mdata.la,mdata.miss$leaf.percentage.missing)

#the final steps are cleanup: remove NA, which leaves for each plant with records for only the leaves it actually had
#cohort2.la<-na.omit(cohort2.la)

##################
###step 3: calclulate the area of each leaf, subtract the area missing from each leaf
###and sum to find the total leaf area of each plant in each time interval
##################
#Adds a column with the leaf area (uncorrected). LA is calculated using the formula in Bruna 2002 Oecologia 
cohort2.la[, "uncorrected.leaf.area"] <- 0.53+(0.831*cohort2.la$leaf.length)

#first removes NA from the column of percet of each leaf missing (in some cases NA because there was no measurment was taken
#then adds a column with the "corrected" leaf area (i.e., corrected leaf area - % missing)
